# Welcome to Meth Academy

## Connected Repo for Angular and Frontend. 
- Also attempted to create the rest with VS Code at first, but could not and it has mainly only md files and some Maven project stuff with extensions.
- I will add the MD content in this ReadMe anyway, but if you want to see what I did with vs code separately from Spring Boot Suite
- ### It is [HERE](https://github.com/Hiratsuna/sweaty.exam)
- Locate the Angular and Node setup in the 'sweaty.dev' folder.
- ## [Docs](https://github.com/Hiratsuna/sweaty.exam/tree/main/docs) 
## - no idea what [this](https://github.com/Hiratsuna/methacademy.springboot_postgresql) is, lol xD
## - [Video Followed for Spring-Java-PostgreSQL-RestAPI Part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWbGV3LLwVQ)



## Update from 30.07 - Spring App (Java Server) finally ran successfully and was able to compile. It is connected to PostgreSQL, success. <3 Now trying to get REST going as well and test it via Postman. Will see if I can connect Angular with the VS Code project or I have to figure out how to place it inside the Spring project and run everything without falling apart. Good Lucks to me! ~
